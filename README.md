Hi , this is my first react web project :)
i have started this project from the front end
and i used supabase for backend
then i realized supabase is just not enough for me
so i learned python flask sqlalchemy and sqlite
i developed and spent so many hours
i didnt work much on the deisgn
most of the design is generated by AI
but i had many ideas for backend
you can see step by step what i made for backend from commits
but here are some things that i made for backend using python:
Login
SignUp
forgot password
change password
real time Contact Us for admin dashboard
real time Notification to send from admin dashboard by using user id or all users
real time database for admin dashboard to see every user with informations
JWT token
added product upload for teacher dashboard and it will be reviewed in admin dashboard before publishing
mark notification as read delete the notification from dashboard
email system for Forgot Password section
and many other things :)
